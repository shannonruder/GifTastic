Gimme a Geometry GIF


This is a dynamic web page demonstrating jQuery and AJAX commands to call up images the user chooses in the GIPHY API. It allows the user to pick a 3D image,  with still Gifs cascading below which can be made to animate by toggling them on or off which will return them to a still image.

The user can also request a shape of their choosing by typing in the name in the unput field then hitting the Submit button.

Hope you enjoy the ride. Torus is my favorite!
